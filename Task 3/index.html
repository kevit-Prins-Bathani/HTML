                    <dd>This sacred mountain also known as Revatak Parvata,
                        rising dramatically from the plains, is covered with
                        Jain and Hindu temples. Pilgrims from far and wide come
                        to tackle the long climb up 10,000 stone steps to the
                        summit, which is best begun at dawn. Be prepared to
                        spend a full day if you want to reach the uppermost
                        temples. Ascending in the early morning light is a
                        magical experience, as pilgrims and porters trudge up
                        the steps. The Jain temples, a cluster of
                        mosaic-decorated domes interspersed with elaborate
                        stupas, are about two-thirds of the way up. The largest
                        and oldest is the 12th-century Temple of Neminath,
                        dedicated to the 22nd Tirthankar: go through the first
                        left-hand doorway after the first gate. Many temples are
                        locked from around 11 am to 3 pm, but this one is open
                        all day. The nearby triple Temple of Mallinath,
                        dedicated to the ninth Tirthankar, was erected in 1177
                        by two brothers. During festivals, this temple is
                        visited by several monks and spiritual heads. Further up
                        are various Hindu temples. The first peak is topped by
                        the Temple of Amba Mata, where newly-weds worship to
                        ensure a happy marriage. Beyond here there is quite a
                        lot of down as well as up to reach the other four peaks
                        and further temples. The Temple of Gorakhnath is perched
                        on Gujarat’s highest peak at 1117m. The steep peak
                        Dattatraya is topped by a shrine to a three-faced
                        incarnation of Vishnu. Atop the final outcrop, Kalika is
                        a shrine to the goddess Kali.</dd>

                        The Bhavnath Mela over five days in the month of Magha
                        (January–February) brings folk music and dancing and
                        throngs of nagas (Saivite holy men) to Bhavnath Mahadev
                        Temple at Girnar Taleti. It marks the time when Shiva is
                        believed to have danced his cosmic dance of destruction.
                        The Girnar Parikrama festival is held in November.</dd>
